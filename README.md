## BGP Project Repository
Welcome to the BGP Project Repository! This repository is dedicated to developing and studying Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementations and applications. This document provides a comprehensive guide to help you get started, understand the project structure, and contribute effectively.

## 📖 Project Overview
BGP is the protocol that allows data routing across the internet. This project focuses on understanding BGP configurations, analyzing BGP routing behavior, and implementing various BGP scenarios for network management and optimization.

This repository is intended for educational purposes, providing materials and examples to explore BGP concepts in depth.

## 🧑‍🏫 Target Audience
This repository is designed with students, network engineers, and faculty members in mind. Whether you are a beginner exploring BGP basics or an advanced user refining BGP configurations, you will find relevant resources here.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Hands-on BGP Scenarios: Examples and configuration files to simulate BGP in different network topologies.
- BGP Analysis Tools: Scripts and tools to monitor and analyze BGP routes.
- Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed explanations of BGP concepts, configurations, and common troubleshooting techniques.
- Sample Assignments: Exercises and labs that can be used for teaching and learning.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Here is an overview of the key folders and files in this repository:
- /docs: Documentation files explaining BGP basics, configuration guides, and use cases.
- /scenarios: Ready-to-use BGP configuration files for different network setups.
- /scripts: Python and Bash scripts for BGP analysis, route monitoring, and log management.
