# Mininet 🌐

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of networking projects using Mininet. Here you'll find various routing implementations from basic static routing to advanced protocols like SRv6. 

## What's Inside 📦

### 1. Static Routing 🎯
- Custom network topology with multiple paths
- Static route configurations
- Network connectivity tests

**Report** :
[Static Routing README](static-routing-mininet/README.md)

### 2. OSPF (Intra-Domain-Routing) 🔄
- Single Area and Multi-Area OSPF implementations
- Area border router setups

**Report** :

### 3. BGP Inter-Domain Routing 🌍
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) setup
- AS (Autonomous System) configurations
- Route advertisement and filtering

### 4. iBGP & eBGP 🔗
- eBGP and iBGP implementations
- BGP policy configurations
