# BGP Routing Implementation

## Project Overview
This project implements BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing in a Mininet environment based on a specified network topology consisting of three Autonomous Systems (AS).

## Network Topology

*The network consists of three Autonomous Systems interconnected through eBGP, with internal routers using iBGP and OSPF.*

### Autonomous System Details

#### AS 100
- **Routers**: R11, R12, R13, R14
- **Devices**:
  - Client: C11
  - Switch: S11 (connects C11 to R11)
- **Internal Structure**:
  - Forms a full mesh topology between all routers
  - R14 serves as the edge router for eBGP connection
- **Connections**:
  - R14 connects to R22 (AS200) via eBGP
  - All internal routers connected via iBGP
  - OSPF running internally

#### AS 200
- **Routers**: R21, R22, R23, R24
- **Devices**:
  - Client: C22
  - Switch: S2 (connects C22 to R21)
- **Internal Structure**:
  - Forms a full mesh topology between all routers
  - R22 and R23 serve as edge routers
- **Connections**:
  - R22 connects to R14 (AS100) via eBGP
  - R23 connects to R34 (AS300) via eBGP
  - All internal routers connected via iBGP
  - OSPF running internally

#### AS 300
- **Routers**: R31, R32, R33, R34
- **Devices**:
  - Client: C33
  - Switch: S33 (connects C33 to R33)
- **Internal Structure**:
  - Forms a full mesh topology between all routers
  - R34 serves as the edge router
- **Connections**:
  - R34 connects to R23 (AS200) via eBGP
  - All internal routers connected via iBGP
  - OSPF running internally

### Protocol Implementation
1. **External BGP (eBGP)**:
   - Connection between AS100 and AS200: R14 - R22
   - Connection between AS200 and AS300: R23 - R34
   - Shown as red dashed lines in the topology

2. **Internal BGP (iBGP)**:
   - Full mesh iBGP connections within each AS
   - Shown as black dashed lines in the topology

3. **OSPF**:
   - Running within each AS
   - Used for internal routing

### Client Connectivity
- C11: Connected to AS100 through switch S11 and router R11
- C22: Connected to AS200 through switch S2 and router R21
- C33: Connected to AS300 through switch S33 and router R33

## Project Requirements
1. Implement the complete network topology in Mininet environment
2. Configure all routing protocols:
   - eBGP for inter-AS communication
   - iBGP for intra-AS routing
   - OSPF for internal routing within each AS
3. Ensure proper connectivity between all clients
